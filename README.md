## Objectives

This core aims to show what a complete design looks like in Cx. We are improving the code as we add features to the language, so generally it requires the latest version of the Synflow SDK to be translated to Verilog or  VHDL. You can download the Synflow SDK [here](https://www.synflow.com/download).

## Limitations

This core is meant to be a demonstration rather than a full-fledged, exhaustive standard-compliant implementation of the standard.

## Known bugs

## Contributions

If you're interested in contributing or extending this core to adapt it to your needs, feel free to contact us, tweet, send an email, or use our [contact form](https://www.synflow.com/contact).
